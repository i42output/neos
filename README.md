# Introduction
"neos" is a cross-platform language agnostic scripting engine with a custom bytecode JIT. 

Development started on 7 Feb 2019 so don't expect a release anytime soon.

# Dependencies
* Boost
* neolib

# Features
* Language agnostic: a schema describes the scripting language to use (theoretically allowing any language to be used).
* RJSON (Relaxed JSON) language schema file format.
* Invent your own scripting language to use with "neos" by writing a new language schema!
