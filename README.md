# Introduction
"neos" is a cross-platform language agnostic scripting engine with a custom bytecode JIT. 

neos is still a work in progress so don't expect a release anytime soon.

# Dependencies
* Boost
* libffi
* neolib
* neonumeric

# Features
* Language agnostic: a schema combined with a semantic concept library describes syntax and semantics of the scripting language to use (theoretically allowing any language to be used).
* EBNF-like language schema file format.
* Invent your own scripting language to use with "neos" by writing a new language schema!
